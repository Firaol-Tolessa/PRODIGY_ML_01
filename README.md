# Linear Regression for Predicting Future House Sale Prices

This repository contains code and resources for a Linear Regression model designed to predict the sale prices of houses. The goal of this project is to develop an efficient model that can accurately estimate the value of a house based on various parameters.

## Methodology

Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable. In this project, the model utilizes Linear Regression to establish a linear relationship between the input parameters and the sale price of a house. The model aims to minimize the loss or error by finding the best-fitting line that represents the correlation between the input features and the target variable.

The methodology involved the following steps:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** A dataset containing information about various houses such as their size, location, number of rooms, etc., was collected. The dataset was then preprocessed, which involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature scaling or normalization if required.

3. **Model Training:** The selected dataset was split into a training set and a test set. The training set was used to train the Linear Regression model, which involved finding the optimal coefficients for the linear equation that best represents the relationship between the input features and the sale price.

4. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model was evaluated using the test set to assess its performance and predictive accuracy. Various evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared score were calculated to measure the model's effectiveness in predicting house sale prices.
